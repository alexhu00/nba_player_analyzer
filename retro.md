# Week 1 Sprint 

### Thing that went well
* Broke down app into components and sections and clarified it with team members during standups
* Had clear documentation of things to do
* Team members were responsive to any issues and/or bugs that popped up individual team members 
* Progress on project was communicated well, and members were able to show demos during synchronous standup

### Things that didn't go too well
* some package errors we might need to address for merging code and solving git conflicts

### What to improve on next sprint: 
* Keep more transparent communication as we progress since work will start to overlap 
* Solve package installation issues
* move tickets whenever they're done 


# Week 2 Sprint 
### Thing that went well
* People were able to pick up on work that others had trouble with 
* Good communication between team members within subgroups (e.g 2 people working on a feature dependent on each other kept each other in the loop) 
* There was clear demos in our synchronous meetings to see individual progress

### Things that didn't go too well
* Not updating of tickets in real time

### What to improve on next sprint: 
* We’ll update tickets during our synchronous meetings so everyone is aligned on what to do next
