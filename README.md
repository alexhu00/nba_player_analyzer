#### Problem:

When scrolling through NBA player stats online there are hundreds of players and no way to compare smaller subsets of players.

- Eg If you are looking at an ESPN stats table below and you want to compare player 2 (Bradley Beal), 9 (Kevin Durant) and 13 (Nikola Jokic) you have to look through the noise of the other 9 players that are in between those three which presents a poor user experience.

#### Solution:

An NBA player comparison website that lets you create your own sortable tables of players as well as compare players head to head.

#### Use Cases

Fantasy Basketball Analysis (Before the draft, during the season for trades and waiver wire pickups)

#### User Stories

- All Players Section
  - As a fantasy basketball user I want to be able to view a sortable table of all the players in the NBA so I can explore different players to consider drafting/adding to my fantasy team
- My Groups Section
  - As a fantasy basketball user I want to be able to create a sortable table of a smaller subset of players in the NBA so I can more directly compare/track a group of players that I’m still considering drafting/adding to my fantasy team
- Head to Head Section
  - As a fantasy basketball user I want to be able to view a player’s current and past statistics against another player and see which player does better in each statistic so I can directly compare two players that I’m considering drafting/adding to my fantasy team
